So, you should know everything you need to know about CompoundRay from me now.

Along with the Motion Detector, which could be used to decode local motion and begin the sstart of a complete drosophila brain simulation, or analyze algorithms for biomimetic motion detection, I also did not do another task on my list, which was to create a scene using photogrammetry.

I got a Insta360 One X2 camera, which is a 360 degree camera, in order to take a video of a natural scene and use the photogrammetry program Meshroom to create a blender scene from it, but I did not have the time to do this. It is an interesting concept you could explore if you wanted to.

Aside from that, there is not much else to say.

Thank you for reading the guide.
