### Creating a Scene in Blender ###
Download Blender (https://www.blender.org/download/)
Open blender and delete objects in the default scene. (A (select all) > X (delete))
Import the example glTF scene. (File > Import > glTF 2.0 > select "natural-standing-sky.gltf")
Add objects to the imported scene (Add > Cylinder or something) (https://www.instructables.com/Beginners-Guide-to-Blender/)
Add a directional light to the scene. (Add > Light > Sun)
Set materials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFrX9OjFUko)
Join all mesh objects (Ctrl+J) (Compound-ray does not accept multiple meshes.)
Edit the UV map and bake colors to the texture. (https://brandonsdrawings.com/texture-baking/)
Select "insect-eye-spherical-projector_Orientation".
Set the path to the eye model. (Properties panel > Camera > Custom Properties > compound-structure)
Export the modified glTF scene. (File > Export > glTF 2.0) (include "Custom Properties" and "Cameras")



### Configuring Input Data ###
git clone https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/CompoundRayTest.git
cd CompoundRayTest
python Functions/convertcsv.py -i path/to/input.csv -o path/to/output.eye
Move csv and new .eye file to InputData folder
The .eye file reconfigures the structure of the eye to the correct format to be input to CompoundRay



### Configuring glTF File (Blender Scene) ###
Go to Scenes/{scene name}.gltf
Find name of camera in glTF
Change "compound-structure" to change .eye file input
The functions and files that CompoundRay should use for a given camera are input through these camera properties in Blender (inputs) 



### Editing Scene Inputs (Parameters for Video Output) ###
Go to Scenes/{scene name}.txt
Change video frames and movement to whatever (frames for entire video, movement can be any position to position translation or rotation)
Match blenderFile to name of gltf
Match videoName to parent folder name
This allows for the python file to read in the correct folder and scene through the txt file
This method allows for one place to quickly be edited to change which scene the python files will run



### Changing Scene (Quickly Switch Which Scene and Parameters are Used) ###
Go to MetaTxt
Change which scene is used with path
Match csv/eye file input used by gltf with csvData and csvNeighbors
In MetaTxt, the txt file itself that is used and all of the other data parameters are changed



### Running (Running all Functions) ###
Once all inputs are configured run:
python Functions/general_compoundray.py (creates compound and panoramic video)
python Functions/data_extraction_test.py (extracts pixel of each ommatidia in scene for each frame)
python Functions/hr.py (applies Reichard function to data_extraction_test output)
python Functions/motion_detector.py (graphs hr output for visualization)
All results should be to folder OutputData (uses data from hr/motion_detector in Pkls folder to calculate signal/activation of each neuron and graph to visualize output)

### Output ###

### Cylinderical Camera ###
