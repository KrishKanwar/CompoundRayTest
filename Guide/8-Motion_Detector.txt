The last thing that I did was apply a motion detector function to the ommatidia data I extracted, called the Reichardt function,

Under the motion detector file, you can see I was provided functions that I would need to use, the most important being the lowpass_filter method. Essentially I have the ommatidial data for a single eye and a single frame, and have another file that is the adjacent ommatidia to each ommatidia if tey were placed on a hex grid, so each ommatidia has six neighbors. I then use the simple math of the Reichardt function, which also requries the lowpass_filter function, for one of those six directions for a single eye, and for a single frame, but for all the ommatidia in the frame, giving me a single quiver (arrow) plot, where they point in the direction of the adjacent ommatidia (flipped if the Reichardt function value is negative), and the size of the arrow is determined by the size of the Reichardt function value for that ommatidia.

This means that for each eye, and for a single frame, I would have six quiver plots for the six different directions you can compare. If you want to consolidate, you can do a vector sum or average of the six plots into a single final quiver plot for the frame.

To show this data, you would plot the quiver plot over each frame of a CompoundRay scene by saving it frame by frame rather than using cv2 video writer, and then reconstructing the video after. I did not have time to do this myself, but it would make the data much more presentable.

I did not do a great job explaining this motion detector part in detail, mostly because I myself required assistance in applying it and the motion detector in general, and I did it near the end of my 8 weeks, so I did not have time to plot it over the scene, analyze the results, or really do anything with the information. It was more of just an idea of next steps you could take with this project.
