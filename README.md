# CompoundRayTest
This repository contains the modifications and testing of CompoundRay https://github.com/BrainsOnBoard/compound-ray

I, Krish Kanwar, made during my 2023 summer HS internship at Janelia in the Reiser lab.

If you are reading this to use this code, or CompoundRay in general, I have a guide folder that lists out the various things required for you to learn and use.

I reccomend having the guide folder open along with the rest of the code so you can look at the files as I talk about them.

Also, if you see any .blend1 files, it is just an automatic backup made by the blender software, I would mostly ignore the .blend1 files and look at the .blend files.
