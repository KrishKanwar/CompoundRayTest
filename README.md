# CompoundRayTest
This repository contains the modifications and testing of CompoundRay I, Krish Kanwar, made during my 2023 summer HS internship at Janelia in the Reiser lab.

If you are reading this to use this code, or CompoundRay in general, I have a guide folder that lists out the various things required for you to learn and use.

I reccomend having the guide folder open along with the rest of the code so you can look at the files as I talk about them.
